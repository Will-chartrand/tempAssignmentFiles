1.

  copy_from_user() and copy_to_user() are different in the fact that they are used for moving multiple things from user space to kernel space and vice versa. 

  These functions are also more versatile and reliable. put_user() and get_user() access the memory directly which is not ideal if something goes wrong. Accessing them indirectly will raise a safer exception if something were to go wrong.

  ioctl stands for input/output control. It's a command which allows one to control the properties of a specific device.
  Read() and write() are useful for reading files and such, but ioctl allows for a more granular interface for dealing with devices (special files)

  3000physicalview.c implements its ioctl in the form of a function called physicalview_ioctl. This function takes in a file pointer,
  an integer for a command, and an unsigned long for the address being accessed.
